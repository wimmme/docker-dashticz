Guidelines for merging
----------------------

Changes to 'en-uk.json' and 'nl-NL.json' in the beta branch are pulled automatically by lokalise.co

In lokalise.co:

* edit incorrect and missing translation keys.
* click 'download' -> build only.

This will create a new pull request in the Dashticz repository.

On github:

* Merge the pull request.
* Delete the lokalise branch.

Done.

Merging of changes in other language files
------------------------------------------

Save the changed language file locally.

In Lokalise click on 'upload' and upload the changed language file.

Then follow the same steps as above.
