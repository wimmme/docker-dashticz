Configuration
=============


The Dashticz configuration is stored in the file ``[dashticz folder]/custom/CONFIG.js`` and consists of several parts.

The first part is used to configure all kind of global Dashticz settings, including the Domoticz connection, language settings, etc. See :ref:`dashticzconfiguration`.

The second part is used to define all blocks.

In the third part the columns are defined, followed by the screens.

These four parts will be discussed in the following sections.
