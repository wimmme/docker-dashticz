v3.4.9: Custom keys in block definition
=======================================

.. note:: Breaking changes. See notes below.

In case you have defined a block with a custom key as follows::

    blocks['myblock'] = {
        idx: 123,
        width:4
    }

then this will have the following consequences:

* The block will have the CSS class ``.block_myblock`` and not ``.block_123``. You may have to change something in ``custom.css``
* If device 123 has subdevices, they will receive the CSS class ``.block_myblock_1`` etc. and not ``.block_123_1``
* On device change the function ``getStatus_myblock(block)`` in ``custom.js`` will be called, and not ``getStatus_123(block)``
